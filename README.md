# LauncherWeb
__Arvind__ should be the most stable and the most functional of all, but was abandoned and not supported anymore because of being outdated.
Right now __Arvind__ is being used by Foxesworld but we don't like it's functionality and working with new private __Foxxey Web-API__
TODO (Won't be done by Foxesworld):
  * Authorisation rewrite
  * Sessions and tokens output using JSON
  * startUpSound support
